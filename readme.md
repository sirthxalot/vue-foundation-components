The Vue-Foundation-Components are a collection of [Vue components](https://vuejs.org/guide/components.html)
based on the [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
frontend framework. They allow you to use the Foundation Framework in a even
handier way by using the Foundation terminology directly in your markup. Write
your code in a more readable way by fresh up the default markup with a more
descriptive syntax.

> **Support Cancelled**: Hi folks! I would like to inform you that the support for this package has been cancelled. This doesn't mean that I am going to remove the repository and start ignoring your issues - no. But I will stop contributing and extending this package.

> **Reason**: First of all this package isn't realy that what it promises. A real Vue component will not use jQuery or the Foundation components, but I didn't find the time to settle up the correct way. I am still in love with the Foundation frontend framework, but I would like to start my own thing, called [Alfred](https://github.com/sirthxalot/alfred).

## Simple Example
             
```html
<dropdown text="DropDown">
Simple dropdown
</dropdown>
```

will generate something like the following markup for you:

```html
<button class="button" type="button" data-toggle="dropdown-1">Dropdown</button>
<div class="dropdown-pane" id="dropdown-1" data-dropdown="" data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
  Simple dropdown
</div>
```

You will find more examples within the `examples/` directory, so you definitely
have to check this out.

## How to Install?

You can use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), in order to install the Vue-Foundation-Components.
Open your command line and run the following command:

```powerShell
npm install sirthxalot/vue-foundation-components --save
```

This command will download the Vue-Foundation-Components into your `node_modules/`,
directory where all local NPM dependencies will be found.

## Getting Started

Vue-Foundation-Components is a single javascript file (see: `dist/foundation.components.js`)
which contain all components you will need, but it has it requirements. Vue-Foundation-Components
will need three (3) libraries in order to work smooth:

* **You have to implement [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** into your website **before loading** the **components**.
* **You have to implement [Motion UI](http://zurb.com/playground/motion-ui)** into your website **before loading** the **components**.
* **You have to implement [Foundation Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/pagination.html)** into your website **before loading the components**.

I assume that you already implemented these requirements within your web project,
before you start using the Vue Foundation Components. Next I would like to show
you the typical starter template for Vue-Foundation-Components:

### HTML Starter Template

```html
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Required Meta Tagging for Foundation Sites -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- Required Meta Tagging for Foundation Sites -->
    
	<title>Document Title</title>

    <!-- Link to Stylesheets -->
    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.2.3/foundation.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/motion-ui/1.2.2/motion-ui.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <!-- Link to Stylesheets -->

</head>
<body>

	...
	
	<!-- Load Vue and Vue Components -->
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/1.0.26/vue.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/foundation.components.min.js"></script>
	<!-- Load Vue and Vue Components -->
	
	<!-- Load jQuery, What Input, Motion-UI, Foundation for Sites -->
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"
			integrity="sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ="
			crossorigin="anonymous"
	></script>
	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/what-input/2.1.1/what-input.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/motion-ui/1.2.2/motion-ui.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/foundation/6.2.3/foundation.min.js"></script>
	<script>
		// Initialize Foundation Components
		$(document).foundation();
	</script>
	<!-- Load jQuery, What Input, Motion-UI, Foundation for Sites -->
</body>
</html>
```

This is how the typical starter template will look like for using Vue-Foundation-Components.
As you can see I have solved most of the requirements using CDN links. You can copy
this starter template and start using the components after grabbing the `dist/foundation.components.min.js`
file and put it into the `js` directory. That's it Folks - You should be ready to
go!
